# LSTM Time Series Forecasting

This project implements a time series forecasting model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It demonstrates how to predict future values based on historical data, such as temperature predictions, using Python libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.

## Project Structure
- `Temperature_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the complete forecasting workflow.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


## Usage

- Open `Temperature_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the LSTM model, and make predictions.
